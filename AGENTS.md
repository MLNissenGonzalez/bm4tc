# Notes for coding agents

Read [README.md](README.md), then [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) (concepts, pipeline, code
map). Design decisions D1–D85 are in [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md), the
source of truth; what is left to do is in [docs/plan.md](docs/plan.md). The code
follows Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design*
([docs/ousterhout.md](docs/ousterhout.md)): deep modules, information hidden in one
place, no pass-through layers.

## Working with Martin

- **He decides.** For a choice, propose 2–3 options with a recommended one and the
  trade-off; push back when an idea looks wrong. For interface or architecture
  choices, first show each option in chat (a code sketch, its effect on pinned
  numbers, the trade-off), then ask.
- Record each new decision as the next D-number in `docs/decisions.md`.
- Commit at each coherent step with a detailed message. **Never push without asking.**
- Write a handoff (a short state + next step + open items file, deleted once folded
  in) only when the context is about to fill or Martin asks.
- Paper sources and rebuttal drafts in `_paper/` are untracked on purpose: reference
  only, keep them out of git.

## Rules for changes

- **Pin before you change behaviour** (D26, D51). The seam tests (`tests/e2e/`) pin
  end-point metrics and per-epoch training curves. A refactor reproduces them
  exactly. A deliberate change re-pins in its own commit, with the reason. Take
  "before" numbers from a `git worktree` of HEAD, not from a background run of code
  you are editing.
- **tensorkrowch first** (D30): tensor-network maths stays in `ConditionalBornMachine`
  on tensorkrowch nodes and contractions, not in plain torch elsewhere. The numerical
  core (contractions, `log_partition_function`, accumulate, sampling) changes only on
  the Phase 9 track.
- **The import rule** (D32): `bm4tc.core` imports neither `analysis` nor `pipeline`;
  `bm4tc.analysis` imports only `core`. A test enforces it.
- Metric keys are built only in `bm4tc/pipeline/metrics.py`; run paths only in
  `bm4tc/pipeline/runs.py`; nothing parses a path (runs are found by `run.json`).
- Clean break (D12): no compatibility shims for old run dirs, configs or CSVs; the
  tag `pre-ousterhout` has the old code.

## Environment

- Conda env `bm4tc` from `environment.yml` (pinned). There is no bare `python` on the
  dev laptop: `conda run --cwd $PWD -n bm4tc pytest -q -p no:logging`
  (`-p no:logging` keeps failure output readable), likewise
  `conda run ... python -m bm4tc ...`. Ad-hoc scripts outside the repo need
  `PYTHONPATH=$PWD`.
- The full suite takes ~3 min: run it in the background and wait for it once.
- Point `BM4TC_DATA_ROOT` at a scratch directory for experiments, to keep datasets
  and outputs out of the repo.
- Local GPU: an RTX 2080 (8 GB); tests must fit in it.
- **Runs happen on the lab HPC**: SSH, jobs started by hand in screen, several GPUs per
  node, **no AI agents there** (D37). Everything must be operable from short commands
  and diagnosable from `status` and the log files.
  `BM4TC_DATA_ROOT=/ceph/chercheurs/nisseng261/bm4tc`. The HPC env needs recreating
  from `environment.yml`.
- `git add` with a pathspec that no longer exists aborts the whole add.

## State (2026-10-07)

Branch `ousterhout`: Phases 0–7 of the refactor are done; `main` is untouched and the
local tag `pre-ousterhout` marks it. Next is Phase 8, running the journal studies on
the HPC (docs/plan.md). `CLAUDE.md`, `DEFERRED.md` and `.claude/` on Martin's other
laptop may hold older notes and an issue list to reconcile.
